    <string name="game_description">PaperFootball is another game of paper-and-pencil type. The main purpose of this game is to place the ball in the opponent’s goal. Player can move ball from the current node to the neighboring one. If this neighboring node has been already visited or this is a node belonging to the field border then the player gets another turn.
